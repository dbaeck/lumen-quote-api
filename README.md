# Simple Lumen Demo App to show a quote of the day

Based on http://loige.co/developing-a-web-application-with-lumen-and-mysql/

## What it does

* /quotes/ - display quote of the day
* /quotes/{id} - display quote with id
* /quotes/api/ - display quote of the day (JSON)
* /quotes/api/{id} - display quote with id (JSON)

## Notes

Modified to run from a subfolder on a shared hoster (repo does not include .env file needed but .htaccess).
